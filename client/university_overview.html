    <h2>Academic Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Universities are institutions that can provide students detailed knowledge in their chosen field. For undergraduates, students who are in between their first to third or fourth year in their program of study are working towards their bachelor’s degree. Students who have graduated from university usually seek a master’s degree or PhD, sometimes both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courses in a student’s program of study are divided into two categories. Their major courses, which are the courses that are more focused on their chosen field. Along with the minor courses, which are optional courses that should be focused after dealing with the work from major courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courses in each program give a certain number of credits, usually between 2 to 4 credits. The amount of credits for a student to graduate ranges between 120 to 150 credits, depending on how long you’ll stay, if you’re a part time or full time student, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes are broken down into lectures, seminars and lab sessions depending on the program you are enrolled in. The university follows a letter based grading system which is added into a student grade point average(gpa) which is the accumulation of all the grades you have earned from the courses you’ve completed so far and a certain gpa is required to progress depending on the program. Some programs will have internships, research projects or capstone experiences for more interactive learning.
