## Purpose and Elevator Pitch

**Purpose**:  
The purpose of UniSavvy is to help students save money while at university and become more aware of the benefits and opportunities available to them. We aim to solve problems related to financial management, provide essential information about student benefits, and guide students in making informed decisions about their spending.

**Problem**:  
Students often face financial struggles and lack sufficient, easy-to-understand information on how to manage their expenses, access financial aid, and take advantage of discounts and university services. UniSavvy aims to address these issues by consolidating key resources and offering personalized financial and academic support.

**Intended Users**:  
UniSavvy is intended for university students, particularly those dealing with financial challenges or seeking better financial management tools and university resources. It also serves students who need more information about the benefits and services offered by their universities.
